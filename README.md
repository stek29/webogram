## [Telegram for Devs](https://web.telegram.org) â€” Unofficial Webogram-based client

This is a web app based on Webogram, the official Telegram client. This is a modified
version that aims to help client and bot developers develop faster.

It includes several useful features:

- Display chat IDs
- Display message IDs
- API Playground
  - In the playground, you can mess around with the MTProto API without needing to
  set up your own client
- Evaluator
  - Simply evaluates a JS statement inside of a Angular `$scope`d controller
- Bot sign in
  - Log in with your bot's API token and see what it sees. Useful for getting bot-specific
  message IDs and testing access to certain groups.

### Coming soon

- Auto-fill/suggest methods on API playground
- Show field for each payload parameter on API playground instead of raw JSON input
